					<h1>Why Planned Parenthood's Abortion Quotas are Anti-Women</h1>
					<h5><i>Aug 22, 2014</i></h5>				
					<img style="width: 100%;" src="protestpp.jpeg">				
					<p>Most of us don’t expect to hear a sales pitch when we go to a healthcare appointment.
					<br></br>
					However, that’s what women get when they go to Planned Parenthood.
					<br></br>
					A new development in Planned Parenthood’s continued desire to coax women into choosing abortion has surfaced, according to reports from Breitbart.com and CNS news.
					<br></br>
					A Planned Parenthood clinic in Aurora Colorado has recently received an award for “exceeding abortion visits [in the] first half of FY12 compared to the first half of FY13,” from the Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains,
					<br></br>
					Why should women care that Planned Parenthood is giving its satellite clinics a pat on the back?
					<br></br>
					Because this clinic’s certificate for being an abortion “over achiever” confirms that Planned Parenthood has minimum quotas for abortions.
					<br></br>
					Abortion quotas put clinics in the business of promoting these life-ending procedures instead of serving women according to their needs. The abortion award in Colorado only further verifies testimonies about Planned Parenthood’s agenda from previous employees, such as Marianne Anderson. Marianne Anderson, who worked at a Planned Parenthood in Indianapolis for two and a half years, told The Criterion:
					<br></br>
					“You have to have so many [abortions] a month to stay open. In our meetings they’d tell us, ‘If abortions are down, you could get sent home early and not get as many hours.’”
					<br></br>
					Planned Parenthood being in the business of peddling abortions above other options is nothing new. A pamphlet by Family Research Council states:
					<br></br>
					According to estimates, a first trimester non-subsidized abortion costs approximately $550. As reported in their 2010 annual report, Planned Parenthood performed 329,445 abortions, yielding approximately $181,000,000 in revenue—solely from abortions performed that year. In contrast, Planned Parenthood made 841 adoption referrals in 2010.
					<br></br>
					Last year Planned Parenthood performed 327,166 abortions and raked in revenue of $1.21 billion dollars last, 45% of which was funded by tax payers, according to their annual report.
					<br></br>
					Planned Parenthood, like any other business, wants to make as much money as possible. But it is disingenuous—if not immoral—for this organization to claim it has women’s health as its top priority while also setting incentives for employees to push one (lucrative) option on women.
					<br></br>
					When vulnerable women enter a clinic they expect to meet a professional who values their health. Not a salesperson, eager to pawn off a product. It is clear, then, that Planned Parenthood cares more about its profit margins than the women it claims to serve.
